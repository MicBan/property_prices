## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using BIS data on property prices to better understand:

1. Which are the countries with the strongest property prices growth since 2000?
2. Where have been property prices the most stable?
3. Is there any substantial difference between nominal and real property prices changes? 

The dataset is available on the BIS website, a direct link is shared in the Jupyter Notebook.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@banach.michal/house-prices-are-high-but-they-will-grow-as-always-really-adeda936dfde).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to the Bank for International Settlements for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the BIS link available [here](https://www.bis.org/terms_statistics.htm).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
